## ⚠️ PART 6: RISK WARNINGS & LIMITATIONS

### 6.1 Statistical Significance Caveat
- **Overall weekday ANOVA**: NOT significant (p=0.076)
- **Overall monthly ANOVA**: NOT significant (p=0.95)
- **Individual comparisons**: Only Wednesday vs Monday is significant

**Interpretation**: While patterns exist, they are not always statistically robust. Use as **one input** in trading decisions, not the sole criterion.

### 6.2 Market Regime Changes
- Analysis spans 26 years including:
  - 2008 financial crisis
  - 2020 COVID crash
  - Multiple RBI policy shifts
  - Reliance business model evolution (telecom, retail expansion)

**Patterns may shift** during regime changes. Monitor rolling 2-year patterns for current relevance.

### 6.3 Transaction Costs
- All returns are **pre-transaction cost**
- Typical costs: 0.05-0.10% per trade
- High-frequency strategies (daily trades) may be eroded by costs
- **Recommendation**: Combine with position trading, not pure day trading

### 6.4 Overfitting Risk
- 26 years of data provides good sample size
- However, mining many patterns increases false discovery risk
- **Validation needed**: Out-of-sample testing on recent 2024-2025 data
