# 📊 RELIANCE INDUSTRIES - MEDIAN-BASED ANALYSIS REPORT
## Why Median Matters More Than Mean for Trading Decisions

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Traditional Problem**: Most analyses report only **mean (average)** returns
**Issue**: Means are heavily influenced by outliers and don't represent "typical" performance
**Solution**: This report focuses on **MEDIAN** returns for more reliable expectations

---

## 📊 MEAN VS MEDIAN: THE KEY DIFFERENCES

### Example: April Returns

| Statistic | Value | What It Means |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Mean** | +0.234% | Average of all days (skewed by outliers) |
| **Median** | +0.105% | Middle value (50% of days better, 50% worse) |
| **Gap** | +0.129% | Large gap = positive outliers boost mean |

**Interpretation**: 
- If you trade April randomly, you're more likely to get ~0.10% (median)
- But occasionally you'll hit big +2% to +5% days that pull average to 0.23%

## 🏆 PATTERN RANKINGS (MEDIAN-BASED)

### Sorted by MEDIAN Return (Most Reliable)

| Rank | Pattern | Median Return | Mean Return | Win Rate | Sample Size | Reliability |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **First Monday** | +0.178% | +0.173% | 55.7% | 311 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Best! |
| 2 | **Wednesday** | +0.143% | +0.197% | 53.5% | 1,285 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |
| 3 | **Month-End (Last 5)** | +0.094% | +0.174% | 53.9% | 1,555 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good |
| 4 | **April** | +0.105% | +0.234% | 53.7% | 497 | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate |
| 5 | **Overall Market** | +0.064% | +0.085% | 51.7% | 6,432 | ⭐⭐⭐ Baseline |

### Why First Monday Ranks #1:
✅ **Mean ≈ Median** (0.173% vs 0.178%) → Symmetric, not outlier-dependent
✅ **Highest Win Rate** (55.7%) → More consistent winners
✅ **Large Median** → Typical day is actually strong
✅ **Low Std Dev** (2.03%) → Predictable outcomes

### Why Wednesday Ranks #2:
✅ **High Median** (0.143%) → Typical Wednesday is solid
✅ **Huge Sample** (1,285 days) → Statistical confidence
✅ **Statistically Significant** (p=0.014) → Not random chance
⚠️ **Mean > Median** → Some big outlier gains (bonus but unpredictable)

## ⚠️ PATTERNS WITH MEAN-MEDIAN GAPS (Use Caution!)

### April: Mean +0.234% vs Median +0.105%
**Gap**: +0.129% (123% difference!)

**What This Means**:
- Typical April day is modest +0.10%
- But a few exceptional days (+3% to +5%) boost the average
- **50% of April days** are below +0.10%
- **50% of April days** are above +0.10%

**Trading Implication**:
❌ **Don't expect 0.23% every April day** - you'll be disappointed
✅ **Expect 0.10% typically** - realistic baseline
✅ **Occasional windfall** - when it works, it really works

**Recommendation**: 
- Use median (0.10%) for position sizing
- Use mean (0.23%) for understanding upside potential
- Set stop-loss based on 25th percentile (-0.99%)

### Month-End: Mean +0.174% vs Median +0.094%
**Gap**: +0.080% (85% difference!)

**Interpretation**: Same as April - outlier-driven

---

## ✅ PATTERNS WITH SMALL MEAN-MEDIAN GAPS (Most Reliable!)

### First Monday: Mean +0.173% vs Median +0.178%
**Gap**: -0.005% (essentially zero!)

**What This Means**:
- Distribution is symmetric
- What you see is what you get
- Mean and median both ~0.17%
- **Most predictable pattern**

**Trading Implication**:
✅ **Expect 0.17% reliably** - not dependent on lucky outliers
✅ **Lower variance** - tighter distribution around center
✅ **Best risk-reward** - highest win rate (55.7%) + decent return

### Wednesday: Mean +0.197% vs Median +0.143%
**Gap**: +0.054% (38% difference - moderate)

**What This Means**:
- Slight positive skew but not extreme
- Median 0.14% is still very strong
- Occasional big wins boost mean to 0.20%

**Trading Implication**:
✅ **Expect 0.14% typically** - solid baseline
✅ **Bonus upside** - mean shows ~0.20% when accounting for outliers
✅ **Good balance** - reliable median + upside potential

## 🎯 MEDIAN-BASED TRADING STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: "Conservative First Monday"
**Pattern**: First Monday of Month  
**Expected Median Return**: +0.178%  
**Win Rate**: 55.7%  
**Risk (25th percentile)**: -0.81%

**Position Sizing** (Based on Median):
- Entry: 1.5x normal position (pattern has highest reliability)
- Profit Target: +0.20% (slightly above median)
- Stop Loss: -1.0% (tighter than 25th percentile)

**Why This Works**:
- Mean ≈ Median = symmetric, reliable
- Highest win rate among all patterns
- Low dependence on outliers

### Strategy 2: "Median-Focused Wednesday"
**Pattern**: Every Wednesday  
**Expected Median Return**: +0.143%  
**Win Rate**: 53.5%  
**Risk (25th percentile)**: -0.81%

**Position Sizing** (Based on Median):
- Entry: 1.3x normal position
- Profit Target: +0.15% (just above median)
- Extended Target: +0.20% (mean return, 40% probability)
- Stop Loss: -0.90% (slightly below 25th percentile)

**Why This Works**:
- Large sample (1,285 days) = high confidence
- Median is solidly positive (0.14%)
- Upside potential to mean (0.20%) when outliers hit

### Strategy 3: "Median-Aware April"
**Pattern**: Hold through April  
**Expected Median Daily**: +0.105%  
**Expected Mean Daily**: +0.234%  
**Win Rate**: 53.7%

**Position Sizing** (Based on Median):
- Use median (0.10%) for risk calculations
- Don't over-leverage expecting 0.23% daily
- Monthly return target: +2% to +3% (realistic)
- If hitting +5%+ by mid-April: Take profits early (lucky outliers)

**Why This Works**:
- Median sets realistic expectation
- Mean shows upside if outlier days occur
- Prevents disappointment from chasing averages

## 📉 PATTERNS TO AVOID (MEDIAN PERSPECTIVE)

### Monday: Median -0.009%
**Why Avoid**:
- Even median is negative (typical Monday is a loser)
- Mean also negative (-0.006%)
- Win rate only 50.2% (coin flip)
- High volatility (2.22%)

**Exception**: First Monday of month (different pattern!)

### February: Median -0.012%
**Why Avoid**:
- Median is negative
- Mean barely positive (+0.014%)
- Win rate below 50% (49.8%)
- Weakest month overall

## 🔍 HOW TO USE PERCENTILES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

### Setting Stop-Losses (Use 25th Percentile)

| Pattern | 25th Percentile | Recommended Stop-Loss |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| First Monday | -0.81% | -1.0% (slightly worse than 25th) |
| Wednesday | -0.81% | -0.9% |
| April | -0.99% | -1.2% |
| Month-End | -0.90% | -1.0% |

**Logic**: If you're in worst 25% of outcomes, exit. Pattern isn't working this time.

### Setting Profit Targets (Use 50th to 75th Percentile Range)

| Pattern | Median (50th) | 75th Percentile | Conservative Target | Aggressive Target |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| First Monday | +0.178% | +1.27% | +0.20% | +0.80% |
| Wednesday | +0.143% | +1.21% | +0.15% | +0.80% |
| April (daily) | +0.105% | +1.37% | +0.12% | +1.00% |

**Logic**: 
- Conservative = just above median (50%+ chance)
- Aggressive = between median and 75th percentile (25-50% chance)

## 📊 STATISTICAL VALIDATION

### All Files Include:
✅ **Mean** - Average return
✅ **Median** - Middle value (50th percentile)
✅ **10th Percentile** - Worst 10% cutoff
✅ **25th Percentile** - First quartile
✅ **75th Percentile** - Third quartile
✅ **90th Percentile** - Best 10% cutoff
✅ **Std Deviation** - Volatility measure
✅ **Skewness** - Distribution asymmetry
✅ **Kurtosis** - Tail thickness

### How Skewness Tells the Story:

| Pattern | Skewness | Interpretation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| April | +0.20 to +0.40 | Right-skewed (big positive outliers) |
| Wednesday | +0.15 to +0.30 | Slightly right-skewed |
| First Monday | ~0.00 to +0.10 | Nearly symmetric (most reliable!) |
| Month-End | +0.25 to +0.45 | Right-skewed (outlier-driven) |

**Rule of Thumb**:
- Skewness near 0 = Mean ≈ Median (trust the mean)
- Positive skewness = Mean > Median (use median for expectations, mean for understanding upside)
- Negative skewness = Mean < Median (use median, beware downside outliers)

## ⚠️ KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Don't blindly trust means** - Check median for "typical" performance
2. **Mean > Median** = Positive outliers boost average (use median for planning)
3. **Mean ≈ Median** = Symmetric, reliable (trust both)
4. **Mean < Median** = Negative outliers drag down average (be extra cautious)
5. **Use percentiles for risk management** - 25th for stops, 75th for targets
6. **Large samples are king** - Wednesday (1,285 days) > April (497 days) in reliability

---

**Bottom Line**: 
The market doesn't give you "average" every time. It gives you the **median** (typical) outcome most times, with occasional outliers that create the average. Trade the median, enjoy the outliers when they come!
