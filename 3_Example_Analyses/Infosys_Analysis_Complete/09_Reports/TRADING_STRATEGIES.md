## 🎓 STRATEGY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Position Sizing Based on Median
- Use **median** (not mean) for calculating expected returns
- Median represents "typical" outcome, mean can be skewed by outliers

### 2. Risk Management with Percentiles
- **25th Percentile**: If you're in worst 25% of outcomes, exit
- **75th Percentile**: Target for aggressive profit-taking
- **Median (50th)**: Conservative profit target

### 3. Pattern Combination
Combine multiple patterns for higher confidence:
- **Example**: Wednesday + Month-End + Positive trend
- Each additional confirming pattern increases probability

### 4. Mean-Median Gap Analysis
- **Small gap (< 0.03%)**: Reliable, symmetric pattern
- **Large gap (> 0.07%)**: Outlier-driven, use median for planning

## ⚠️ RISK WARNINGS

1. **Past performance ≠ Future results**
   - Patterns can change over time
   - Market regimes shift

2. **Pattern degradation**
   - As more traders discover patterns, they may weaken
   - Monitor pattern consistency quarterly

3. **Sample size matters**
   - Patterns with < 100 observations are less reliable
   - Large samples (> 500) are more trustworthy

4. **External factors**
   - Global events can override patterns
   - Company-specific news takes precedence
