## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Reliability Assessment (Mean vs Median)

**Why Median Matters**:
- **Mean** can be skewed by outliers (a few extreme days)
- **Median** represents the "typical" outcome (50th percentile)
- **Small gap** between Mean and Median = Consistent, reliable pattern
- **Large gap** = Pattern depends on occasional big moves

### Pattern Interpretation:

**Wednesday**: Positive outliers boost average (use median for realistic expectations)
**Monday**: Symmetric distribution (mean and median both reliable)
**April**: Negative outliers drag down average (be cautious)
**First Monday**: Positive outliers boost average (use median for realistic expectations)
